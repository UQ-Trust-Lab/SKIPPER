            from California consumers to post a
            conspicuous privacy policy on its website
            stating exactly the information being collected and
            those individuals with whom it is being shared,
            and to comply with this policy. -

            <strong>Fair Information Practices&nbsp;</strong>The
            Fair Information Practices Principles form the
            backbone of privacy law in the
            United States and the concepts they include have played
            a significant role in the development of
            data protection laws around the
            globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is
            critical to comply with the
            various privacy laws that protect personal
            information.&nbsp;<strong>In order to be in line with

        <p>We also agree to the individual

            individuals have a right to
            pursue legally enforceable rights against data
            collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not
            only that individuals have enforceable rights against
            data users, but also that individuals have
            recourse to courts or a government
            agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
            data processors.</p>
