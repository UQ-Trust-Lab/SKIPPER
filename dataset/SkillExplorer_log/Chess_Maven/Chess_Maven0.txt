Here's the skill Chess Maven, by LC Publishing.Welcome to Chess Maven. In this game you will be able to play chess against computer or real opponents using vocalized commands. There is an optional tutorial if you are interested, and otherwise we will jump right into the game. Chess consists of back and forth play between two players. The player with the white pieces goes first, and the goal of the game is to capture your opponent's king. The board is comprised of files and ranks. Files run along the bottom of the board from A through H and ranks run along the side from 1 through 8. You can always ask for a hint to hear your best possible moves. There have been 0 moves in this game. Do you want to continue the tutorial.

To start the ingame tutorial say 'tutorial' To find out how many hints you have say 'how many hints' and To increase the difficulty say 'increase the difficulty'. What move do you want to make.
tutorial
To move your piece, simply combine a file and a rank into a square. This skill uses algebraic notation for moves, though it should recognize most descriptive notation moves as well. For example, you could move a pawn forward from B 2 to B 3 or a knight from B 1 to A 3. Should I go on with the tutorial.
a knight
Would you like me to continue the tutorial.
Yes
You can also say piece names instead of squares. For example, if your rook is in its starting square and you are white you could say rook to A 5. You can also omit the start square and just say the end square and I will do my best to make the correct move. Finally, if you are attacking an enemy piece you can say queen takes pawn and I will find the matching move and make it. Would you like me to continue the tutorial.
No
